One important method of transmitting messages is to transmit in their place
sequences of symbols. If there are more messages which might be sent than there
are kinds of symbols available, then some of the messages must use more than one
symbol. If it is assumed that each symbol requires the same time for
transmission, then the time for transmission (length) of a message is directly
proportional to the number of symbols associated with it. In this paper, the
symbol or sequence of symbols associated with a given message will be called
the "message code." The entire number of messages which might be transmitted
will be called the "message ensemble." The mutual agreement between the
transmitter and the receiver about the meaning of the code for each message of
the ensemble will be called the "ensemble code." Probably the most familiar
ensemble code was stated in the phrase "one if by land and two if by sea." In
this case, the message ensemble consisted of the two individual messages "by
land" and "by sea", and the message codes were "one" and "two".
